# (ﾉ◕ヮ◕)ﾉ*:・ﾟ✧ Ahoy there!

By day I write C++/Python device libraries for [Pimoroni](https://github.com/pimoroni/) and maintain our PicoSystem and 32blit software & communities. By night I'm an independent tech writer throwing words at [Gadgetoid.com](https://www.gadgetoid.com/) to see what sticks.

### Useful Pico Things

* Pico Universal Flash Nuke - Does what it says on the tin! - https://github.com/gadgetoid/pico-universal-flash-nuke
* dir2uf2 - Pack a directory and append it to a MicroPython uf2 - https://github.com/gadgetoid/dir2uf2
* py_decl - Python code to read Pico's binary declaration format - https://github.com/gadgetoid/py_decl

### Pinout.xyz

I also maintain [Pinout.xyz](https://pinout.xyz), your one stop shop for Raspberry Pi GPIO pinout information.

### Pico.Pinout.xyz

Got a shiny new Raspberry Pi Pico? I also maintain a [beautiful, interactive and (hopefully) accessible pinout for the Pico](https://pico.pinout.xyz/).

### Pi 400 as a USB Keyboard

Want to [turn your Raspberry Pi 400 into a USB HID keyboard](https://github.com/Gadgetoid/pi400kb)? I've got you covered, too!

### 32blit

Occasionally I still poke 32blit SDK - a toolkit for developing games on embedded systems, born from a handheld of the same name. Learn more at https://32blit.com
