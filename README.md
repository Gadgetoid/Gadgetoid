# (ﾉ◕ヮ◕)ﾉ*:・ﾟ✧ Ahoy there!

By day I write C++/Python device libraries for [Pimoroni](https://github.com/pimoroni/) and maintain our PicoSystem and 32blit software & communities. By night I'm an independent tech writer throwing words at [Gadgetoid.com](https://www.gadgetoid.com/) to see what sticks.

### Pinout.xyz

I also maintain [Pinout.xyz](https://pinout.xyz), your one stop shop for Raspberry Pi GPIO pinout information.

### Pico.Pinout.xyz

Got a shiny new Raspberry Pi Pico? I also maintain a [beautiful, interactive and (hopefully) accessible pinout for the Pico](https://pico.pinout.xyz/).

### Pi 400 as a USB Keyboard

Want to [turn your Raspberry Pi 400 into a USB HID keyboard](https://github.com/Gadgetoid/pi400kb)? I've got you covered, too!
